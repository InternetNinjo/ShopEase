##   Overview
* We plan to build an online store using Microsoft Azure. We want it to handle a lot of customers and work reliably. To do this, we'll use Azure services like Virtual Networks, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and Application Gateway. 

* This setup will give us a strong, secure, and cost-effective online shopping solution that can grow as needed.
