#   E-commerce Website Deployment on Azure

##   Overview
* We plan to build an online store using Microsoft Azure. We want it to handle a lot of customers and work reliably. To do this, we'll use Azure services like Virtual Networks, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and Application Gateway. 

* This setup will give us a strong, secure, and cost-effective online shopping solution that can grow as needed.
##   Deployment Algorithm

### Start of Algorithm


    1. Azure Setup:
        Create Azure Subscription (if not existing).
        Create Resource Group to organize resources.

    2. Virtual Network Configuration (AVN):
        Create Azure Virtual Network.
        Define and configure Subnets.
        Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs) for traffic control.

    3. Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) Configuration:
        Create Virtual Machine Scale Set.
        Configure Custom Image for VMSS.
        Define Scaling Rules (e.g., based on CPU utilization).
        Integrate Application Deployment with VMSS.
        Configure custom data and cloud init.

    4. Web Application Deployment:
        Package E-commerce Application and dependencies.
        Develop Deployment Script (or use Azure DevOps).
        Deploy application to VMSS instances.

    5. Application Gateway Configuration:
        Create Azure Application Gateway.
        Configure Backend Pool with VMSS instances.
        Implement SSL Termination.

    6. Verification and Testing:
        Verify successful deployment of all Azure resources.
        Test website functionality and performance.
